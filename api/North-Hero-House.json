    "A lovely spot on route 2 and feet from the lake. Good swimming and can pull your boat up to the few slips they have along the roc Jetty. There is a BnB and a nice fancy rstaurant in the main hous across the street from th lake. FReservations are highly recommended. Open only occassionally in the winter. In the summer they serve food and drinks out on the jetty. They are well know for their lobster rolls."
